# Data_Science_HarvardX_Capstone_Choose_your_own_project

These documents are my reports for the "Choose your project" assignment from the Capstone course (HarvardX PH125.9x, Data Science Course). 
This project aims to create a proper recommendation system using the 515K Hotel data set. These reports include different levels of analysis:

- Data exploration
- Reshaping of some parameter
- Training of the recommendation system
- Testing of the recommendation system 
- Comparision between PCA and regression-based recommendation model

The data set is as well available via this link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/lkxeeb7kp0ryma8/Hotel_Reviews.csv?dl=1 and has been downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe
